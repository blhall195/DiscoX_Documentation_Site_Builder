## Step 2: Plug your DiscoX into your PC (in write mode)

When connected to your PC, your DiscoX mounts in `Read-only` mode by default. To enable `Write` mode for software updates, turn it on while holding the top button. Once mounted, you can relase the top button and it will appear in your file explorer, allowing you to edit or replace files.
